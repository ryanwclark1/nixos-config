# Window Rules Configuration Loader
# -----------------------------------------------------
#
# This file sources window rule configurations from the windowrules/ subdirectory.
# Window rules control how specific applications and windows behave.
#
# Available window rule files (organized by application category):
# - system-utils.conf    - System utility dialogs (pavucontrol, blueman, etc.)
# - file-dialogs.conf    - Generic file dialogs
# - nautilus.conf        - Nautilus file manager specific rules
# - browsers.conf        - Web browser rules (PiP, sharing indicators)
# - terminals.conf       - Terminal emulator opacity rules
# - editors.conf         - Code editor and note-taking app rules
# - media.conf           - Media player rules
# - gaming.conf          - Gaming application rules (Steam)
# - virtualization.conf  - Virtualization tools (QEMU, virt-manager)
# - dialogs.conf         - System dialog and authentication rules
# - scratchpad.conf     - Scratchpad workspace rules
# - screenshots.conf     - Screenshot tool rules
# - walker.conf          - Walker launcher rules
#
# Window rules control:
# - Floating vs tiling behavior for specific applications
# - Window sizing and positioning
# - Opacity and transparency settings
# - Workspace assignments for applications
# - Special handling for dialogs, popups, and utility windows
# - Gaming and media application optimizations
# - Browser picture-in-picture positioning
#
# Window rule syntax (modern windowrulev2 format):
# windowrulev2 = RULE, class:^(APPLICATION_CLASS)$
# windowrulev2 = RULE, title:^(WINDOW_TITLE)$
# windowrulev2 = RULE, class:^(APP)$, title:^(TITLE)$
#
# Common rules:
# - float                    - Make window floating
# - tile                     - Force window to tile
# - fullscreen               - Start in fullscreen
# - size W H                 - Set window size
# - move X Y                 - Position window
# - workspace N              - Assign to specific workspace
# - opacity N                - Set window opacity
# - idleinhibit MODE         - Prevent idle (fullscreen/always)
#
# Use `hyprctl clients` to see application class names and titles.
