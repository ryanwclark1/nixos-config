Debug the issue: $ERROR

**Debugging Process**:

1. **Evidence Collection**:
   - Gather error messages, stack traces, logs
   - Collect system state information
   - Identify reproduction steps

2. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - Develop multiple theories based on evidence
   - Rank hypotheses by likelihood
   - Identify test cases for each hypothesis

3. **Systematic Testing**:
   - Test each hypothesis methodically
   - Validate or refute based on evidence
   - Document findings

4. **Root Cause Identification**:
   - Identify underlying cause (not just symptoms)
   - Verify with evidence
   - Assess confidence level

5. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Implement minimal fix
   - Verify solution works
   - Add prevention measures

**Output**:
- Root cause analysis with evidence chain
- Investigation timeline
- Solution with verification
- Prevention recommendations
